Objective:
- For production, this website should run on static web hosting, example AWS S3.
- Fast load on small CPU device
	- not require heavy processing on client side
- Can run without dependant on other services/API
- Can run for whole year without breaking (need data for whole year)
- Source, *MUST* coming from JAKIM's e-solat
- Use dayjs instead of momentjs
- use unfetch package (small package compared to axios)

Data folder structure: /data/2020/WLY02/20200905.json
Time zone: /data/zones.json

Data will be prepared in advanced by me on yearly basis.
